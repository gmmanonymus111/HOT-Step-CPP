# HOT-Step CPP — AMD ROCm/HIP build script.
#
# Community-contributed backend (PR #115). Requires ROCm 6.1+ (hard floor in
# ggml/src/ggml-hip/CMakeLists.txt). No CI coverage builds this — see
# .github/workflows/rocm-build.yml for the compile-only guard.

# The wipe is intentional: every backend script configures into the shared
# engine/build/, and a stale CMakeCache from another backend poisons a HIP
# configure. This is always a full rebuild.
